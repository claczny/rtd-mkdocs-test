In order to maximize the time for teaching and learning on multi-omic analyses, we would ask you to prepare yourself using the materials below.
These include mainly fundamental aspects, such as relevant publications and computational skills including setting up your laptop, connecting to the [uni.lu HPC](https://hpc.uni.lu/), and running test applications.
Please try these out as early as possible and let us know should you encounter issues so we can try to help in debugging them.

# Publications
You can find a copy for your personal use in the [publications owncloud folder of the course](https://owncloud.lcsb.uni.lu/s/OrtKd15mdiZIXRj).
The access password was or will soon be sent to you.
Please note that these should not be distributed, unless the respective licenses allow so.

### Single-cell analyses

# Compute

If possible, we strongly encourage using a Linux-based or macOS-based laptop, simply because most tools are command line-based.
Please do not worry if this does not represent a feasible solution for you.
Most of the computations will be performed on the uni.lu HPC remotely.

In case local computations are necessary and should not be compatible with your laptop, we will ask you to team-up in small groups.

### Accessing the HPC
You have or will receive your uni.lu HPC login credentials from us.
Please use these credentials and follow the instructions on the [uni.lu HPC Access website](https://hpc.uni.lu/users/docs/access.html) for [Linux](https://hpc.uni.lu/users/docs/access/access_linux.html), [macOS](https://hpc.uni.lu/users/docs/access/access_linux.html), and [Windows](https://hpc.uni.lu/users/docs/access/access_windows.html).

N.B. The port on which the SSH servers are listening is not the default one (i.e. 22) but **8022**, so please make sure to adjust this in your configuration.
